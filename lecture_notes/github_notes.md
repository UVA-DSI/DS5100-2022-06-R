Learning Objective: The student voluntarily uses version control software.  
 
Comment: I left this vague for future proofing, we will be teaching it with git, my motivation for this objective is that once I see a student decide on their own that they need to make a repo for this project I know we have achieved the goal, there could be a second objective about proficiency, but i figure that comes with time over the rest of the program.

Skills:  
- fundamental  
git at the command line  
git through the github interface  
github default repo webpage  

-advanced  
improve efficiency/productivity  
collaboration facilitation (social network layer of github)  
github pages  

Approach:  
Today's students are GUI native so we start there. Once they have a mental model from the GUI then we proceed to CLI. 'git clone' is the bridge.

GUI:  
- part 1: reading repos
- part 2: creating repos
- part 3: editing repos
- part 4: forking/pull request repos

CLI:  
- git clone
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git push

Pedagogy:  

This material is best learned through repetition and as a necessary part of another exercise. With a few targeted lessons on key points to get them started: Examples coming

teaching 2.a reading repos: we should send students to existing github repos constantly. they will get many repetitions at viewing the page and learning how to read them. this is akin to reading documentation for python or something. we want them to feel comfortable looking at a github page

teaching 2.b creating repos: we want to instruc the students to create several repos throuought the 5010 course, each one will reinforce the lesson. the first should be structured and guided (possible demo/follow along) in class early and then by the end we just give the simple command "make a repo for this"

part 3 CLI: is best taught sync with the teaching doing a 'live coding exercise'. that way the students get to watch the professor work and observe and ask questions. frequent use of 'git status' really helps the students to learn. intentional errors/mistakes that are common for new users should be produced live and fixed live with comment.

Suggestion usage of time:  
- two in class sessions on git/github (1 hour of in class time)
- 30 min intro to github gui (week 1)
- 30 min intro to git cli (week 3)

Reading assignments (done before class)  
- selections from Pete's resources below adapted to fit our precise situation [2.1-2.6 from Jan 2021 bootcamp]
- https://medium.com/@abhishekj/an-intro-to-git-and-github-1a0e2c7e3a2f

Homework/assessment  
- create a github account (technical orientation)
- create a repo (graded for completion)
- fork a repo (no need to grade b/c part of 3d)
- pull request the class repo (graded for completion)
- integrate github repo page into a presentation you give in 5010 (graded for completion)
- during the presentation we will tell if they understand/get github and can intervience later if they are not)
Collusion with other courses:

What really makes this work is we integrate with other courses. 6001 and 6021 should point people to github repos to read/get code. The more reps the better.

Existing Resources:
I have added you to the collab site where my recent github resources live for the last bootcamp. This material is not the right match for what we have been talking but can easily be shaped to our purposes, whatever those wind up being. I would draw your attention to a few items.

top level git page - this page is a summary of everything in the collab site on git/github
section 2.6 - the most important page, it has a good graphic and a video by yours truly (7min)
